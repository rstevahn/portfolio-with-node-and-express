# Portfolio using Node and Express
### Project 6, Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree

Extra Credit features included:
- package.json has been configured with a start script
- error handling middleware renders the 'error' Pug template
- style.css has been customized with changes to some text colors, background colors, font (addition of Merriweather Sans for headlines), and transitions when hovering over the portfolio image links.

This project uses node.js, Express and Pug to serve up a portfolio of each of my JavaScript projects
to date. It includes an index page, an about page, and dynamically generated project pages for each
of the projects.
